Information for the current IT Executive.

## About

This file is for the current IT Executive. This is a list of the how-to's to do your role in relation to the website. The website is hosted on Github pages because it's free and it's simpler. The websites are built in pure HTML, CSS, and JS. In this document, I'm assuming you have zero knowledge of Github or Github pages. If you have any questions, fire me a message on Facebook or chat to the previous years IT person.

## Using Github

### Why?

Pretty simply: it's free, keeps a copy of all files and copies of previous years so it's easy to get past speaker and sponsor information.


### Creating a new website repository

We have a QCOP organization. If you are not apart of this organization then you need to contact the co-chairs or the previous years co-chairs. They have `owner` permissions. All QCOP related code can be found [here](https://github.com/QCOP). Each year creates a new repository (In short: repo) for their website so following the naming convention `QCOP-20XX`. There is no copy of the [2016](https://github.com/qcop/qcop-2015) year however it was a fork of the 2015 in terms of looks, and the speaker and sponsor assets exists in [2017](https://github.com/qcop/qcop-2017).

As an owner, you can create the new repository: click the `+` in the top right corner, then `New Repository`. From the new repository page you can change the owner (using the dropdown) to be `QCOP`. Insert the name (`QCOP-20__`) and the description (`The Queen's Conference on Philanthropy website for 20__-20__`). Keep the repository public because website assets are public anyway (plus private costs money). Check `Initialize this repository with a README`, and add an `Apache License`. Then click `Create repository`.

### Cloning your repository

Now open your new repository, so the URL would be something like: `https://github.com/qcop/qcop-20XX`. It will look like:

INSERT IMAGE OF 2018 of repo with 2018


Keep this open. Now you need `git`. Git and Github are two different things. Git is a versioning software for developers. And Github at a high level is a UI for public Git servers. I'm not going to explain it too much more but if you do some Googling, someone explains it.


#### Installing Git

Go to [https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/) and hit the download on the right side.

Now install that.


#### Cloning

Open your repo Github page again. Under the green button, you'll see a URL. This should be `https`, if not click `Use HTTPS`. Copy it. It will be something like `https://github.com/qcop/qcop-20__.git`.


Open a terminal (this is a program) on your computer. Navigate to the desired folder using:
```
# Lists the current folders and files in your current directory
ls

# Navigates into a folder
cd ______

# Navigates back a folder
cd ..
```
